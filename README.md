# Video-Plethysmography
Reads heartrate from a video of a human face. 
Run the eye tracker program first and then run the pleth program. Put the video file in the same folder as the code. Watch the output video as the pleth code is running to see if you need to change "xstretch" and "raisefactor" based on the individual's facial shape. It is still very experimental and not finished.
